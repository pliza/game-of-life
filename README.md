A cellular automaton in 2 dimensions can be represented as an evolving 2D grid of cells, each of which is colored according to its current state.  As such, it lends itself to animated visualization.  To generate such visualizations I employed PyGame, a lightweight game engine for Python that makes windowing and game state evaluation simple and accessible. In the given code there are references to a few PyGame functions whose role is to set up and administer the game window.
